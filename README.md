# prof-code-tests

Thanks for swinging by! For now, unless explicitly asked not to share, I'm pushing code up that I'm working on for companies that ask me to attempt a code challenge. I'm also thinking of throwing some other 'homework' of sorts in here that helps prepare for those types of challenges. Take care.
