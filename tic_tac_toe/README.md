This is a quick ruby mock-up of the classic children's game, Tic Tac Toe. You'll need to run this program in terminal. You'll need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) on your machine to play the game.

### Instructions
1. To clone down, run this line in terminal:

	```
	$ git clone git@github.com:sunsheeppoplar/prof-code-tests.git
	```

2. Navigate into the the tic_tac_toe folder:

	```
	$ cd tic_tac_toe
	```

3. Making sure that you've already installed Ruby on your computer (see above), run the game:

	```
	$ ruby ttt.rb
	```
